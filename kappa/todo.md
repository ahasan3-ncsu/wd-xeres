# TODO

- Plot temp vs x : DONE
- Tally the energy exchanged between subsystems
	- It's already done by fix ave/time
	- DONE
- Add etotal & econserve in thermo
	- We don't have total energy anywhere!
	- DONE
- Change the number of electronic grids
	- Check to see if 9k changes
	- DONE
- Run half supercell for kappa
	- Maybe not necessary right now
	- Running a job won't hurt
	- DONE

- Green-Kubo formalism?

# Thoughts

Total energy missing! Cannot prove/disprove anything without that.
Does the 9k change with the number of grids? Might provide insight.
I didn't use other methods for thermal conductivity.
A method that doesn't depend on temperature gradient
might circumvent the TTM problem.
