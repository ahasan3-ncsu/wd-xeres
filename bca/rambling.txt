Now what?

Discretized E and l.
For smaller bubbles, we probably need more l values.
Each radius might need a different set of l.
Anything to get a smooth profile.

The issue is that nel_mesh has an impact.
This needs convergence testing.
It's not gonna be fast but whatever!

Can we use a simple interpolator for l?
Need to make a plot to see how smooth it looks.
Making a lot of PchipInterpolators is expensive.

Finally, the matter of equilibrium pressure.
I need to find the number density.
1 mol = 134 g = 6.022e23 atoms

What's the density of Xenon in solid and liquid state?
solid: 3.64 g/cc = 3.64e6 g/m^3 = 1.63e28 atoms/m^3
liquid: 3.1 g/cc = 3.1e6 g/m^3 = 1.39e28 atoms/m^3
gas: 0.005366 g/cc = 5366 g/m^3 = 2.41e25 atoms/m^3

I guess 1.39e28 is the limit for gas.
