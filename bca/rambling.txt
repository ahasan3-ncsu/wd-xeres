Now what?

The mesh resolution should be variable.
Maybe it should be R_b/2 up to 4*R_b.
For 4*R_b to D, it can be 250 angstrom.
8*8 + 4*4 = 80 points
This needs to be tried and tested.
Because it'll go into the paper as well.

The pressure graph needs error bars.
Actually, add error bars wherever possible.

Finally, the matter of equilibrium pressure.
I need to find the number density.
I'm using the van der Waals EOS with gamma=1.55.

What's the density of Xenon in solid and liquid state?
1 mol = 134 g = 6.022e23 atoms
solid: 3.64 g/cc = 3.64e6 g/m^3 = 1.63e28 atoms/m^3
liquid: 3.1 g/cc = 3.1e6 g/m^3 = 1.39e28 atoms/m^3
gas: 0.005366 g/cc = 5366 g/m^3 = 2.41e25 atoms/m^3
I guess 1.39e28 is the limit for gas.
