Now what?

plan of action
1. which point is better for exponential fit
2. run a fine energy grid for 8 nm and 64 nm (1k each)

the critical point is at R_b
linear before that
exponential after that
to get the exponential decay, what point should we get?
the point at 1/3rd the way or 1/2 the way
let's make a fit to see which point is better

how does the trend change with energy?

is it better to just get grid point values?
after all, that's all that matters

the major problem is the energy dependence

should we look into the total number of recoils
what if the left tapering is because of bubble volume
let's look into it; there might be some clues

only Y (see reason below)
all radii
2 different l (needs justification)
how many energies? (this is the issue)

there might be patterns
like 20 MeV and 100 MeV are very similar
hold on a second
I have to do Y then, not I. 102 vs 75 MeV.
