Now what?

For the offcent sims, add one more run at R_b.
Also, why not run at D as well?
The resolution size needs to be at least R_b/2.

Variable surface mesh size? Why not? :)
Smaller square inside a bigger square.

junctions: n_parts + 1
nel for each part: n_parts
this all goes into mesh_info
get_grid_points: needs to take low and high
add_xi: need to add a loop for adding the parts

The issue is that nel_mesh has an impact.
This needs convergence testing.

2D/nel_mesh is the resolution for the surface mesh.
We need to play around with delta too.

The pressure graph needs error bars.
Actually, add error bars wherever possible.

Finally, the matter of equilibrium pressure.
I need to find the number density.
I'm using the van der Waals EOS with gamma=1.55.

What's the density of Xenon in solid and liquid state?
1 mol = 134 g = 6.022e23 atoms
solid: 3.64 g/cc = 3.64e6 g/m^3 = 1.63e28 atoms/m^3
liquid: 3.1 g/cc = 3.1e6 g/m^3 = 1.39e28 atoms/m^3
gas: 0.005366 g/cc = 5366 g/m^3 = 2.41e25 atoms/m^3
I guess 1.39e28 is the limit for gas.
