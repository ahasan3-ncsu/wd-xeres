Now what?

- xi needs to be calculated properly
- the assumption was alpha is the same all across the surface mesh
- this produces bad results near the origin
- maybe we should allow each mesh element to have a different angle
- A/cos(alpha) will have to change then
- l calculation will also be more complicated
