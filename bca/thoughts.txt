Energy discretization

- E_min calculation from xe_calc graph (20 eV)
- let's just work with 64 nm radius bubbles - one at a time

4 location for off-centered value
headon, Rb + delta, 2 in the middle of the former two
^ maybe choosing different relative positions will help
find a pattern
pick the energy that corresponds to the re-solution peak
for the peak, maybe have 3 middle positions
for other energies, maybe have 1 or 2 middle positions

how to deal with convergence of one configuration?
same with ion convergence
run 1000 at a time
check the difference in all 3 values:
#xe interactions, #outside, #resolved
actually, just one is enough. work with #resolved.

TOML

name (positional argument)
Y, I - particle N (--y_num) - make this 0 by default
Y, I - particle E (--y_en) - full energy by default
Y, I - particle pos (--y_pos) - centered by default
sphere R (--sph_r)
sphere rho (--sph_rho)
cuboid corners (--cub_corn)

DIRECTORY structure

input replicator
disseminator

need to create an intermediate file with the following:
- num_ions
- num_xe_recoils
- num_xe_outside
- num_xe_resolved

create symlinks to scripts/ as necessary

headon (equil_pres)
- 64 nm (radius)
  - Y_1MeV (ion type and energy)
	- run_1
	- run_2
	- ...
	- aggregate data
  - I_5MeV
	- run_1
	- run_2
	- ...

Work order

- toml file generation using cli args
- a runner script that utilizes the above generator
- convergence tester
