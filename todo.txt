TTM
x Check the energy deposited into the electronic system.
x Print out total energy of electronic subsystem and the energy
  transferred from the electronic to the atomic subsystem.
x Try to implement a cumulative sum of the energy transferred.
x Why does the TTM command output wrong energy? Different formula.
x Use ttm/mod as a substitute for ttm. Use a constant C_e.
  The electronic system doesn't transfer energy at all!
- Check different initial temp profiles (diff R_spike, diff formulas).
  Don't worry about the formula. Just make sure the total energy from
  the fix output makes sense.

Reading
- Read the SHI papers by Kolotova et al.
- Read Matthews' re-solution in UC paper.

Low Priority
- Make plotting scripts.
